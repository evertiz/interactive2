	<p>Whatif by Shel Silverstein
Last night, while I lay thinking here, some Whatifs <br>crawled inside my ear and pranced and <br>partied all night long and sang their same old Whatif song: Whatif I'm <br>dumb in school? Whatif they've <br>closed the swimming pool? Whatif I get <br>beat up? Whatif there's <br>poison in my cup? Whatif I <br>start to cry? Whatif I <br>get sick and die? Whatif I <br>flunk that test? Whatif green hair <br>grows on my chest? Whatif nobody <br>likes me? Whatif a bolt of lightning <br>strikes me? Whatif I don't <br>grow taller? Whatif my head <br>starts getting smaller? Whatif the fish <br>won't bite? Whatif the wind <br>tears up my kite? Whatif they <br>start a war? Whatif my parents <br>get divorced? Whatif the bus <br>is late? Whatif my teeth <br>don't grow in straight? Whatif I <br>tear my pants? Whatif I never <br>learn to dance? Everything <br>seems well, and <br>then the nighttime Whatifs strike again!
