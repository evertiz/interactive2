	<p>Whatif by Shel Silverstein</p>

	<p><br>Last night, while I lay thinking here,
<br>some Whatifs crawled inside my ear
<br>and pranced and partied all night long
<br>and sang their same old Whatif song:</p>

<p><br>Whatif I'm dumb in <br>school?
<br>Whatif they've closed the swimming <br>pool?
<br>Whatif I get beat <br>up?
<br>Whatif there's poison in my <br>cup?
<br>Whatif I start to <br>cry?
<br>Whatif I get sick and <br>die?
<br>Whatif I flunk that <br>test?
<br>Whatif green hair grows on my <br>chest?
<br>Whatif nobody likes <br>me?
<br>Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes <br>me?
<br>Whatif I don't grow <br>talle?
<br>Whatif my head starts getting <br>smaller?
<br>Whatif the fish won't <br>bite?
<br>Whatif the wind tears up my <br>kite?
<br>Whatif they start a <br>war?
<br>Whatif my parents get <br>divorced?
<br>Whatif the bus is <br>late?
<br>Whatif my teeth don't grow in <br>straight?
<br>Whatif I tear my <br>pants?
<br>Whatif I never learn to <br>dance?</p>

<p><br>Everything seems well, and then
<br>the nighttime Whatifs strike again!
