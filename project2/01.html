	<p>Whatif by Shel Silverstein</p>

	<p><br>Last night, while I lay thinking here,
<br>some Whatifs crawled inside my ear
<br>and pranced and partied all night long
<br>and sang their same old Whatif song:</p>

<p><br>Whatif I'm dumb in school?
<br>Whatif they've closed the swimming pool?
<br>Whatif I get beat up?
<br>Whatif there's poison in my cup?
<br>Whatif I start to cry?
<br>Whatif I get sick and die?
<br>Whatif I flunk that test?
<br>Whatif green hair grows on my chest?
<br>Whatif nobody likes me?
<br>Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?
<br>Whatif I don't grow taller?
<br>Whatif my head starts getting smaller?
<br>Whatif the fish won't bite?
<br>Whatif the wind tears up my kite?
<br>Whatif they start a war?
<br>Whatif my parents get divorced?
<br>Whatif the bus is late?
<br>Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight?
<br>Whatif I tear my pants?
<br>Whatif I never learn to dance?</p>

<p><br>Everything seems well, and then
<br>the nighttime Whatifs strike again!
</p>
