	<p>Whatif by Shel Silverstein</p>

<p><br>Last night, 
<br>while I lay thinking here,
<br>some Whatifs crawled 
<br>inside my ear
<br>and pranced and partied 
<br>all night long
<br>and sang their same 
<br>old Whatif song:</p>

<p><br>Whatif I'm dumb in school?
<br>Whatif they've closed 
<br>the swimming pool?
<br>Whatif I get 
<br>beat up?
<br>Whatif there's poison 
<br>in my cup?
<br>Whatif I start 
<br>to cry?
<br>Whatif I get sick 
<br>and die?
<br>Whatif I flunk 
<br>that test?
<br>Whatif green hair grows 
<br>on my chest?
<br>Whatif nobody likes 
<br>me?
<br>Whatif a bolt of lightning 
<br>strikes me?
<br>Whatif I don't grow 
<br>taller?
<br>Whatif my head starts 
<br>getting smaller?
<br>Whatif the fish won't 
<br>bite?
<br>Whatif the wind tears 
<br>up my kite?
<br>Whatif they start 
<br>a war?
<br>Whatif my parents 
<br>get divorced?
<br>Whatif the bus 
<br>is late?
<br>Whatif my teeth don't 
<br>grow in straight?
<br>Whatif I tear 
<br>my pants?
<br>Whatif I never learn 
<br>to dance?</p>

<p><br>Everything seems well, 
	<br>and then
<br>the nighttime Whatifs 
<br>strike again!
